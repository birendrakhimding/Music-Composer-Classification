## Project Overview

This project uses deep learning techniques to classify MIDI files by their composers. The dataset includes works from classical composers including Bach, Bartok, Byrd, Chopin, Handel, Hummel, Mendelssohn, Mozart, and Schumann.

## Dataset Structure

- `musicData/train/` - Training data organized by composer
- `musicData/dev/` - Development/validation data
- `musicData/test/` - Test data
- `saved_pianorolls/` - Processed piano roll representations
